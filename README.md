ArcGIS/Python tools developed to contribute to United States Geological Survey Elevation-derived Hydrography project. 
Project was a partnership with USGS and North Carolina State Universtity for Lucian's Master's project.

The file folders within the Assessment Automation package can be stored anywhere on a user’s machine but the subfolders must remain in the parent directory. 
The relative file structure is imperative for the operability of the tools in “EDH_AssessmentTools.tbx.”
A general suggestion for backwards compatibility: EDH Evaluation Tools.tbx should be saved “back” to the earliest version used by projected users.

See "EDH_MGIST_UserGuide.pdf" for step-by-step instructions on how to use the tools.
Further documentation has been submitted directly to USGS. 
It contains more specific information on the management of the project files.
